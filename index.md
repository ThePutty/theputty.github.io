My name is Tomas Putna. I have the following qualities:

- programmer | engineer | developer | IT and such
- I rock a great mustache

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
